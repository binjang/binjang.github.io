      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made several unsuccessful attempts at creating a personal blog in the past. These were some of the reasons behind those failures:
I became too obsessed with aesthetics, spending a lot of time without completing a single blog. The overall process was too complex, causing me to abandon it after a few posts. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much to write about. Yet again, I&amp;rsquo;m starting a new blog, but this time with Hugo.</description>
