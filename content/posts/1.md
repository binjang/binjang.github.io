# Creating a Personal Blog
I actually had several unsuccessful attempts in creating a personal blog. These were some of the reasons:
- I got too obsessed with the aesthetics, spent a lot of time without completing one.
- The overall process was too complex, I gave up on it after a few posts.
- Didn't have much to write about.

Yet again, I'm starting a new blog, this time with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

# Why Hugo?
Hugo was a clear winner over other frameworks, for several very important reasons:

### It's convenient.
I was already making [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) notes, in markdown format, for a personal knowledge base / idea management. Hugo pages are just markdown files, so write a markdown file and you don't have to do anything else to update.

### It's fast.
Since it's static and already optimized for markdown files, the websites are lightning fast. This one was very surprising to me, as it was even faster than some of the vanila html-css-js websites that I've made on my previous attempts.

These were the two of the most important reasons. On next post, I'll write about how I actually did this, in less than an hour.
